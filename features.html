            Small and handheld, no larger than your phone. This is a benefit for the user, as they can take 
            their Pep Pet anywhere on the go. In fact, it is portable to bring to school in case the user wants to
            interact with other users there. This is important because the Pep Pet is meant to be utilized outside and
            having device that is large-scale would be an unconvenience to ther user experience.

            device is a unique way to teach their child a sense responsibility and attentive care. Thsi aspect can be
            seen as a painkiller if parents want to see their child grow up to be responsibile in taking care of 
            anything in the future.

            Pep Pets, so they will be notified of any new friends/connections made with the Pep Pet. This is a benefit
            for parents as this ensures the safety and oversight of the children when communicating with other users
            outside.
