			<p> Parents want their children to interact and be friends with other children, but giving them phones is daunting.
				Oftentimes they are not prepared for the responsibility of one, or will abuse the privilege.
				On the other hand, having a phone or device is integral to the social wellbeing of kids in middle school. They
				congregate around games and devices, and not participating in the latest app or game can be very exclusionary for
				many
				kids.
			</p>
			<p>
				So how do we reconcile these two problems?
			</p>
			<p> Pep Pets is a digital pet, similar to a Tomagchi, that you can take care of by becoming more active, attentive, and
				interactive with other users.
				It can makeshift phone that teaches children to become responsible of important belongings and one's/others
				wellbeing.

				The pocket device has a simple GUI where kids can interact with their digital pet. The device is responsive to 
				physical activity (walking) in order to encourage kids to go outside. Additionally, we will have a parent-facing 
				website where parents can register their email with their kids' Pep Pets, so
				they will be notified of any new friends/connections made with the Pep Pet.
